# Refactor to Design Patterns

**Refactor to Design Patterns** is a Java collection with a lot of badly written (hard to understand, maintain and debug) pieces of code. The goal is to refactor them according to the original **GOF design patterns**.

## Your job

- Open up a package, like `com.csmastery.chainofresponsibility`, run the relevant tests in `src/test/java`, and try to understand the codebase in the first place
- Figure out the problems in the codebase
- Go to [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog) and read the description about the pattern
- Refactor the bad code :)
